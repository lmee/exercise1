Cheerful and happy was his mood,
He to the poor was kind and good,
Also supplies of coal and wood,
He never spake a word was rude,
And cheer'd those did o'er sorrows brood,
He passed away not understood,
Because no poet in his praise,
Had penned a sonnet in his praise,
'Tis asd, but such is world's ways.
